## Summary 

A simple responsive table featuring randomly generated user data from a third party API. 

### The App 
[Random User Generator](https://jeanadelaire.github.io/user-listing/)

### API
[Random User](https://randomuser.me/)

### Tech
- React: This app was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which set up a basic file structure to add custom components to. I used lifecycle methods to call data on component render to ensure only twenty users are called during a session. 

- Axios: A promise based http client used to call twenty random users from the api on page load.  

### Future iterations 
- More sorting functionality will be added to sort by all table header options.
